Why
---

Debugging is hard. In microcontrollers world this is especially true. Usually it's done through Serial communication with a host computer. Which brings two complications:

1. Developed project should be connected to the computer at all time, which is limiting factor if project has to be mobile.
2. Debugging information should be text only, which is limiting factor if data can be better represented in graphical way.

One of my future projects will be mobile, and some of the information I would want to debug there will be better represented graphically. For that reason I've made some testing of couple of the screen that I have around.
